- Embedded Tomcat
- JSON

## Prerequisites

- Java 22 installed
- Maven installed

## Installation and Running

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AngelGiurov/Cash-Desk-Module-Angel.git
    cd cash-desk-module
    ```

2. **Build the project with Maven:**

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Run the application:**

    java -jar target/cash-desk-module-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

   The application will start on port **8080**.

## API Usage

### Custom Header

All API requests must include the custom header:

- **Must create environment variable `API_KEY` with value `f9Uie8nNf112hx8s`**.
- *Good practice for security measures but we have to test it somehow. ðŸ™‚*

- **Header Name:** `FIB-X-AUTH`
- **API Key:** `UPON REQUEST`

## Testing with Postman

A Postman collection with 5 requests is included in the repository under the `postman` directory.

1. **Import the Collection:**

    - Open Postman.
    - Click on **Import** and select the `CashDeskModule.postman_collection.json` file.

2. **Execute Requests in Order:**

    - The requests are numbered from 1 to 5.
    - Ensure the custom header `FIB-X-AUTH` is included with the API key `f9Uie8nNf112hx8s`.

## File Structure

- **Transaction History:** `transaction_history.txt`
- **Cash Balances and Denominations:** `cash_balances.txt`

These files are updated with each API call.
